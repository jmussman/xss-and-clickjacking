            <h1>Cross-Site Scripting and Clickjacking</h1>

            <p>Cross-site scripting, and the same-origin policy, confuses folks.
                Same-origin sounds like if scripts are loaded from different places then there should be restrictions on what they can do.
                But same-origin does not affect *any* scripts that a document loads.
                It turns out that all the scripts a document loads, either embedded with a script tag or loaded via AJAX from anyplace
                on the network, all share the same JavaScript and DOM environments in the browser.
                And, what about CORS?
                Well, CORS protects a server, not the client.
                Clients are blocked from contacting random web services, unless the server contacted passes CORS headers to allow the connection.
                When it does, there is nothing stopping the client from communicating!</p>

            <p>So, what does <i>same-origin</i> really accomplish?
                Only one thing: if a document loads another document from a <i>different</i> site into a frame or window, then the browser blocks the code in the
                first document from accessing the JavaScript and DOM environment in the frame or window containing the second document!
                Who does same-origin protect?
                The user, not the application!
                And, the application code cannot expect it to work.
            </p>

            <h4>Example 1 - Embedded IFrame</h4>

            <p>This is an embedded login page inside an iframe.
                The password is the word "secret".
                If you click the login button, the event handler set by the JavaScript in the iframe will run.
                Look at the console to see that it logs the content of the two fields.
                And that the login.js script is generating that output:</p>
            <iframe class="login-frame" id="login-frame-1" src="http://localhost:3000/login.html"></iframe>

            <h4>Example 2 - Clickjacking and Overlays</h4>

            <p>This is the same embedded login page inside an iframe.
                This time it is overlaid with what should be a transparent div and button directly over part of the form, but
                the div and button are opaque gray and have a blue border so they can be identified in the example.
                If you click the login button you are really clicking the button that overlays it.
                The event handler set by the JavaScript in main document will run, picking up the values from the form
                and writing them to the console.
                Then it will invoke the click method of the button in the iframe, so the document there works as expected.
                This is <i>clickjacking!</i></p>
            <iframe class="login-frame" id="login-frame-2" src="http://localhost:3000/login.html"></iframe>
            <div id="iframe-overlay-2" class="overlay">
                <button id="button-overlay-2" class="overlay"></button>
            </div>

            <h4>Example 3 - Clickjacking without the Overlay</h4>

            <p>Clickjacking can take place without the overlay too!
                Although, that may not be in the true spirit of the definition of clickjacking.
                All we have to do is add another event handler to the button in the document in the frame, and we can
                hijack the information there!
                The login.js script click handler runs before the index.js click handler, because index.js added it after login.js.</p>
            <iframe class="login-frame" id="login-frame-3" src="http://localhost:3000/login.html"></iframe>
            
            <h4>Example 4 - XSS Blocked by the Same-Origin Policy!</h4>

            <p>This is the same embedded login page inside an iframe, but now it is loaded from a different address.
                It is also overlaid with the div and button directly over the form.
                If you click the login button you are really clicking the button that overlays it, but this time
                it fails to get the values from the document in the iframe, or simulate the button click,
                because the page in the div is loaded from a different origin!
                The same thing will happen if we just tried to hijack the button directly.</p>
            <p>So, the whole point of the same-origin policy is to prevent me from visiting a page that launches
                another page (like my bank account), and tricks me into entering secret information in a form
                while it hijacks that information behind the scenes.
                Important: same-origin <i>helps</i> prevent the <i>user</i> from XSS and clickjacking, it does not do anything
                to project the <i>application</i>.</p>
            <iframe class="login-frame" id="login-frame-4" src="http://localhost:3001/login.html"></iframe>
            <div id="iframe-overlay-4" class="overlay">
                <button id="button-overlay-4" class="overlay"></button>
            </div>
